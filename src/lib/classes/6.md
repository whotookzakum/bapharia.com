Blast Archer has some unique facets that contribute to its skill ceiling, including relatively complex animation cancels, having to predict player movement, timing buffs well, and consistently hitting weak points.

## Unique Mechanics

### Buff Charge Gauge
By dealing damage, Blast Archers can charge the Buff Charge Gauge up to level 3. Using the subaction, Cure Arrow, will consume the gauge and place a healing field at the selected location. The heal amount will differ based on the gauge level. The gauge will charge more when dealing critical hits and hitting enemy weak points.

### Weak-point Targeting
Blast Archers deal increased damage when hitting an enemy's weak point. These points vary between enemies, such as the head or back. You may be able to hit weak spots with auto aim on some enemies, but this is unlikely to be the case for most enemies so players will have to switch between auto and manual aim for maximum efficiency.
