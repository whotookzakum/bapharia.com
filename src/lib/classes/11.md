Spell Caster's main difficulty is surviving; players that are patient and thoughtful about their positioning and skill-use can maintain high damage with exceedingly simple controls. Non-Icicle builds may have to be more thoughtful about EP management.

## Unique Mechanics

### EP Gauge
Most Spell Caster skills do not have cooldowns, and instead consume EP from the EP Gauge. Different skills require different amounts of EP. EP will slowly recover over time, and can be quickly recharged by holding the subaction button.
