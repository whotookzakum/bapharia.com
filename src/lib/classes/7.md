Twin Striker possesses skills that allow lots of room for error, such as super armor and self-healing skills. The class has a relatively low skill ceiling for optimization, with the main animation cancel being repeated use of the class action.

## Unique Mechanics

### Combo Gauge
Twin Strikers build Combo Gauge with each successful hit. The Combo Gauge is a damage multiplier that increases the power of all their attacks. If their HP drops below a certain amount, the gauge will be reset back to 0.
