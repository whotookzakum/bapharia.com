## Unique Mechanics

### Cartridge
Certain Heavy Smasher skills consume ammunition from the cartridge, with different skills consuming different amounts. If there are remaining rounds in the cartridge, *holding* the subaction button will reload the cartridge. If the cartridge is completely empty, *pressing* the subaction button will initiate a Quick Reload, granting 2 extra rounds of ammunition.
