Most of Heavy Smasher's animation cancels are not that impactful in group play. The class boasts good survivability and simple skills. After getting used to the cartridge system, the core challenge is grouping enemies safely without prematurely ending Rock Body.

## Unique Mechanics

### Cartridge
Certain Heavy Smasher skills consume ammunition from the cartridge, with different skills consuming different amounts. If there are remaining rounds in the cartridge, *holding* the subaction button will reload the cartridge. If the cartridge is completely empty, *pressing* the subaction button will initiate a Quick Reload, granting 2 extra rounds of ammunition.
