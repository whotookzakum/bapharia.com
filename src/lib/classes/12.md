Aegis Fighter has simple and straightforward skills and animation cancels, making the class easy to learn. The biggest challenge may come from enemy aggro management.

## Unique Mechanics

### Shield Gauge
Aegis Fighters can hold down the class action button to enter a guard stance. Successful blocks of enemy attacks will consume Shield Gauge. Once the gauge is depleted, shield-related skills will be temporarily unavailable. Press the normal attack button after blocking to perform a powerful counterattack.
