## Character Creator
<img src="/guides/cosmetics/banner.webp" alt="Character creator demonstration">

When creating a character, you have access to fewer options than the beauty salon. However, you have the option to select basic clothing. 

Before the game released, you could design your character beforehand using the [Benchmark Software](https://blue-protocol.com/guide/benchmark), and later import the creation in the live servers. This only applies to initial character creation—there is no option to import from or export to a file from the beauty salon.

Future additions to the character creator will also be accessible at the beauty salon.

## Beauty Salon

The beauty salon can be accessed through the Aesthetician. There are various courses to select from:

- Regular course lets you change everything except sex
- Type-change course lets you change everything including sex
- Courses for exclusively changing hair or make up

Like the character creator, the beauty salon allows you to preview your character in different lighting, positions, and zoom levels.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    A free regular-course ticket can be obtained from the quest <a href="/db/quests/SQ101_120">A Whole New Me</a>.
</StickyNote>

<StickyNote type="tip">
    You can save a couple character designs in the salon and load them up later. To finalize changes, you will need a ticket corresponding to the selected course.
</StickyNote>

<StickyNote type="warning">
    Changing sexes will not change the sex of your outfits.
</StickyNote>

<StickyNote type="caution">
    The face you select will determine the availability of certain parts. For example, Face A may correspond to body size S, while Face B may correspond to body sizes M and L.

## Cosmetic Items

Besides weapons, everything visible on your character is fully cosmetic. Items that provide stats do not affect your appearance, and items that change your appearance do not provide stats.

Cosmetic items can be explored in the [database](/db) and include:
- Weapon Skins
- Outfits (hat, top, gloves, bottom, shoes)
- Underwear
- Accessories (head, ears, eyes, cheeks, hands, upper back, lower back)

## Dying

At the Dyeworker, you can recolor your clothing. Eligible items will have a color marker in the bottom right of the item thumbnail. 

Dyes are mainly obtained through events and gacha. Outfits that are a combination of multiple parts, like top and bottom, and will require more dye. 

Saturation and lightness can be adjusted by consuming Toning Agents. The outfit can be reset to its original color with a Dye Remover.

<StickyNote type="note">
    Dying an outfit will modify the secondary color as well. You cannot change the secondary color manually—it is paired with the primary color and depends on the outfit.
