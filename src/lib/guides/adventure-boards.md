An Adventure Board is a collection of tasks that correlate with the board's theme. They are very important in progressing through the game.

Adventurer Rank boards are a prerequisite to **increasing your Adventurer Rank**, which **raises your max level cap** and unlocks more Main Story and Side Quests. 

Additionally, Weapon boards provide **weapon recipes**, and Enhance Imagine boards provide **Enhance Imagine recipes**.

For data on specific Adventure Boards and their tasks, check the [database](/db).

## Obtaining Boards
Adventure Boards can be obtained by completing quests--mainly Key Character Quests, indicated by a quest icon with horns. After unlocking a board, you can accept it from your Command Menu > Quests > Adventure Boards.

## Accepting Boards
Adventure Boards need to be accepted before you can make progress toward their tasks. Click on a board and then click the long rectangular accept button at the top. You can also choose to display it on the in-game HUD to easily track progress on tasks.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    Up to 8 boards can be accepted at a time, so accept the boards with overlaping tasks at the same time! 
</StickyNote>

## Task Tree
Every Adventure Board comes in a unique tree shape, where the tasks along the main path must be completed in order. Tasks that do not have a line connected to them can be completed in parallel, at any time. It's highly recommended you complete the side tasks, as they can provide a considerable amount of crafting materials or other helpful things related to the main reward.
