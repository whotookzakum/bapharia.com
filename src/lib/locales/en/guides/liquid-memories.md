## How to unlock
Liquid memories can be unlocked through side quests. There are currently two vials for every color.
Check the world map for the side quest locations.

## How to use
Once you finish a side quest, you will unlock one empty vial to store a single color of liquid memories.
Fill the vial by doing actions related to its effect, or by simply waiting.

Pay the liquid memory stand attendant to activate effects. Drinking multiple vials of the same color increases the *duration* of the effect.

You can not drink a liquid memory if its effect is already active. You need to completely use it up to reactivate that color.
