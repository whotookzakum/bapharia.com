You have 15 seconds to initiate a skill before the effect expires. The damage increase is applied once a skill is *initiated*, so chargeable skills can be held indefinitely while maintaining the Ignition effect--useful when waiting for buffs, debuffs, heals, elemental burst, combo gauge via Lava Impact, etc.

If a skill that Ignition is applied to is cancelled--for example charging [Desperado](#734) then dodging--the damage increase is lost.
