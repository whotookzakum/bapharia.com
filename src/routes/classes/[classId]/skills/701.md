This skill is very useful for animation cancelling for DPS, or for tanking incoming damage. Axe Tornado's short cooldown allows you to use it in between almost all tactical skills. The finishing attack added by **G3** has a small knockback effect, and there is a relatively long landing animation.

The finishing attack can be performed by holding the skill button or pressing it twice. Alternatively, you can perform a springboard jump instead of the finisher--just note that Axe Tornado's uppercut doesn't provide much altitude.

Canceling this skill early enough (before the first hit) will end the skill without putting it on cooldown.
