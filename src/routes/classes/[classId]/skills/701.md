This skill is very useful for animation cancelling for DPS or when you're about to be hit due to the damage reduction and heals it provides. It also synergizes well with most skills because of its short cooldown, allowing you to use Axe Tornado in between almost all tactical skills. The finishing attack added by **G3** has a small knockback effect, and there is a relatively long landing animation.

The finishing attack can be performed by holding the skill button or pressing it twice. Alternatively, you can perform a springboard jump instead of the finisher--just note that Axe Tornado's uppercut doesn't provide much altitude.
