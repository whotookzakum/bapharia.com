War Cry's SP Armor prevents attacks from being canceled despite being hit, ensuring your skills can be used (mostly) without interruption. 

SP Armor itself **does not** prevent status ailments or reduce damage taken--these are additional effects of War Cry. Elemental Burst cannot be prevented with War Cry.

The G4 skill can also prevent elemental effects from thunder (interrupts actions) and darkness (chance to miss), but not the other elements. War Cry has to be activated before you are hit with elemental attacks for this to work.
