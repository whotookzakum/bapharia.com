Blood Axe stacks with skills that have built-in life steal.

**β** does not show a buff icon. If you go under full HP, the damage increase is deactivated, but it can be regained by once again reaching full HP. What matters is whether or not you are full HP *when the hit registers*--**not when you begin casting the skill**. For example, you may use Blood Axe then use [Desperado](#734) α at 90% HP; the first hit will deal normal damage but recover you to 100% HP, allowing the second hit to get the damage boost from Blood Axe β.
