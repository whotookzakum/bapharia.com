Storm Rush very quickly fills the combo gauge. 

Storm Rush locks your position in place when attacking while airborne, proving effective against flying enemies. You can dodge to exit certain parts of the animation while mid air. You can also use the long air time to avoid floor shockwave attacks from enemies. The final attack knocks down enemies.

**α**'s range expansion is quite large, effectively turning into a ranged attack.

**β** decreases total damage in the long-run because the combo gauge increase is drastically reduced. However, it may be advantageous when you want to prioritize party chain and elemental charge accumulation/elemental burst over damage, such as against boss enemies.
