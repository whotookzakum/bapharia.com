    "616": "This skill is heavily backloaded towards the last hit, so it's recommended to perform all 4 hits whenever possible. The forward input version is more effective when hitting two or more enemies.",
    "624": "The heal area remains for a brief moment, so players can walk into it if they aren't already in range when the skill activates.",
    "700": "Due to Twin Striker's short cooldowns, it's recommended to only use the backwards input of this skill to apply the attack up buff. There may be niche use cases where the sideways input could be useful in mobbing, but it pushes enemies too much to spam consistently. The post-skill delay isn't that high so your class action is better used for other skill cancels.",
    "701": "Provides Super Armor and reduces damage taken (at G2) for the entire duration of this skill, making it useful for tanking hits. This skill can be used to cancel most Twin Striker actions. Jumping early enough into the animation (before the first hit) will cancel the skill without putting it on cooldown. It's recommended to use this skill for the entire duration (including the final hit while airborne).",
    "1900": "Provides Super Armor up until the 2nd hit.",
    "1901": "Provides Super Armor until the projectile is fired.",
    "SmasherDodgeAttack": "Provides Super Armor until it hits.",
    "1912": "Provides Super Armor after the first few frames until the slam lands.",
    "1920": "Provides Super Armor until the tornadoes spawn.",
    "1911": "Provides Super Armor until charging to level 1.",
    "1921": "Cannot be cancelled during 2nd hit animation.",
    "1930": "Barely any ending frames that can be cancelledâ€”better to follow up with another skill.",
    "1932": "Dodging during the spinning animation will give you more time to act on the grouped on mobs than dodging after letting go of spin."
