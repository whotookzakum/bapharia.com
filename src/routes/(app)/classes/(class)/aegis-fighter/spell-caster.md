## Spell Caster
The Spell Caster (Spell Weaver) is a long-range classes that uses Fire, Ice, and Thunder elemental skills to deal massive damage to enemies from afar. Spell Casters use a rod as their weapon, and are **mainly a damage class**. Their skills excel in dealing burst damage and minimal crowd-control, and their continuous use of elements can greatly contribute to the [Elemental Charge Gauge](/guides/elements#elemental-charge). 

### EP Gauge
Spell Caster skills do not have cooldowns, and instead consume EP from the EP Gauge. Different skills require different amounts of EP. EP will slowly recover over time, and can be quickly recharged by holding the subaction button.

### Spell Caster Class-shared Abilities
