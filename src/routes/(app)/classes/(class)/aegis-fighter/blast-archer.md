## Blast Archer
The Blast Archer (Keen Strider) is a long-range class that attacks enemies and **supports** allies from afar. Blast Archers utilize a bow and quiver to provide support from a safe distance. Their skills excel in supporting teammates through healing, buffing, and dispelling abnormal statuses, as well as applying debuffs on enemies. They have various Earth-elemental skills, and can be played with either auto-targeting or manual aim. 

### Buff Charge Gauge
By dealing damage, Blast Archers can charge the Buff Charge Gauge up to level 3. Using the subaction, Cure Arrow, will consume the gauge and place a healing field at the selected location. The heal amount will differ based on the gauge level. The gauge will charge more when dealing critical hits and hitting enemy weak points.

### Weak-point Targeting
Blast Archers deal increased damage when hitting an enemy's weak point. These points vary between enemies, such as the head or back. You may be able to hit weak spots with auto aim on some enemies, but this is unlikely to be the case for most enemies so players will have to switch between auto and manual aim for maximum efficiency.
