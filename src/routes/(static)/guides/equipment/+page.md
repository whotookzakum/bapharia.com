An overview of all the gear in the world of Regnus.

## üó°Ô∏è Weapons
Weapons can be crafted at the crafting machine found in town. Upon creation, the weapon will have some random values:
- Elemental ATK
- Bonus damage against a certain monster type
- Number of slots (used for fusion)

See them in detail in this video:

### Weapon Fusion
Fusion is the process of attaching Battle Imagine to your weapon to provide passive stat boosts. Weapons must have at least one empty slot to be eligible for fusion. Speak to the Weapon Reconstructor in town to begin. 

<StickyNote type="warning">
    There is currently no way to remove a fused battle imagine from a weapon.
</StickyNote>

When performing fusion, the catalyst battle imagine will be consumed and its ability will be applied to your weapon as a passive stat increase. The value of the ability is random, ranging from 1‚òÖ to 5‚òÖ. The number shown in your inventory or at the crafting machine is the 3‚òÖ value.

<!-- | Stats | 1‚òÖ | 2‚òÖ | 3‚òÖ | 4‚òÖ | 5‚òÖ |
|:------|:---|:----|:---|:----|:----|
| STR, INT, DEX, ATK, Stamina, Healing, Healing (B. Imagine) | 16 | 18 | 20 | 22 | 24 |
| DEF, Stamina, Reduce CD (ULT), Healing, Healing (B. Imagine) | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| Crit Rate, Reduce Dmg Taken (Melee/Ranged), Damage Up (Melee/Ranged/Regular Attack/B. Imagine/ULT) | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| Max HP | | | 100 | | |
| Max HP | | | 150 | | |

Stats may appear in multiple categories depending on the source, i.e. Ferocious Beast gives Stamina +10, while Spooky Goat gives Stamina +20.  
Some stats apply as flat values (STR +20) and some apply as percentages (Reduce Cooldown (ULT) 8%).

#### Reduce Cooldown (ULT) Formula
This ability is applied as a percentage. Formula provided by [Baskmedia](https://baskmedia.jp/bp-ct/).  

    ( Cooldown - Tactical Ability ) √ó (100 - Imagine Ability) / 100

The default cooldown for ultimates is 60 seconds. The tactical ability **Reduce ULT Cooldown** reduces it by 7 seconds at level 3. Imagine ability can be applied from equipped battle imagine and fused battle imagine (currently unknown if it is multiplicative or additive). 

With these combined, you can reduce your ULT cooldown from 60s to 46.64s (or lower). -->




## üêà Imagine
Imagine are the souls of creatures that inhabit the world of BLUE PROTOCOL.
<!-- > *Imajinn are the embodiment of spiritual elements, such as powerful emotions or thoughts of a living creature.*   -->

### Battle Imagine
Battle Imagine provide active abilities to assist you in battle and can be fused into your weapons for passive stat bonuses. They can be crafted at the Imagine Research Institute in town.  

A crafted imagine will randomly take one of the available abilities shown in the crafting menu. For example, Land Fox's available abilities are Crit Damage Increase and DEX Increase.

When a battle imagine is equipped to your character, its ability and stats will be applied to your character, and its active skill will be available. 
<StickyNote type="tip">
    Battle imagine skills have 3 types: Attack, Heal, and Support.
</StickyNote>

Up to 2 battle imagine can be equipped (duplicates allowed) and their cooldowns are independent of each other.

### Enhance Imagine
Enhance Imagine are equippable items that provide passive stat bonuses. 

Like battle imagine, enhance imagine can be crafted at the Imagine Research Institute and will randomly take one of the available abilities shown in the crafting menu.

There are 5 enhance imagine slots--they can only be equipped in their respective slots. Equipping higher tier enhance imagine allows you to increase your Adventurer Rank.

### Mount Imagine
Mount Imagine are rideable creatures useful in traversing the open world.

Mounts have a standard running speed which is faster than running on foot. They also have a faster sprinting speed which consumes the Dash Gauge. The gauge will recover while not dashing.

<StickyNote type="note">
    Mount animations will not disrupt your movement. You can mount, dismount, and attack in one fluid motion without pausing!
</StickyNote>

The only mount imagine available in CBT was the Land Fox, obtainable at Lv 8 from Studz's side quest in Minsterhorn.
