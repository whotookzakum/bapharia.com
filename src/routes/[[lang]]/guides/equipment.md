## Overview
Equipment in BLUE PROTOCOL comes in three distinct formsâ€”weapons, Battle Imagine (skills), and Enhance Imagine (armor). All items can be equipped at any level but will <b style="color: var(--color-levelsync)">Level Sync</b> if your class level is lower than the item level, reducing its stats (more details [here](/guides/stats#level-sync)).

### Discarding, Dismantling, and Selling Equipment
Visit the storage NPC to dismantle your unused equipment for crafting materials or sell them for Luno. They can also be discarded from your inventory or storage.

## Limit Break
Limit Breaking equipment involves consuming duplicate copies of an item for a chance to enhance its stats. The higher the Limit Break level, the more materials needed and the lower the chance. Failing a Limit Break attempt **will not consume the duplicate copies of the item**, but will consume Luno and Fusion Materia (a generic material for Limit Breaking).

As of v1.06.100, the maximum Limit Break level is +5, which requires 1 base copy plus 11 duplicates. The only exception are the *EX Battle Imagine*, which are Battle Imagine of the story characters (such as Feste and Tyris), which require only 1 base copy plus 5 duplicates.

You can transfer passive lines and ability plugs through the Limit Break system, effectively letting you Limit Break now and optimize later. For example, if I had a 9% damage line on a weapon but later found one with 12% damage, I can simply transfer the 12% line over to my main weapon. Weapons will automatically take the highest socket count out of all of the duplicates and the base copy. 

Additionally, a max Limit Break item can still be fed duplicate copies to transfer passives, plugs, and sockets. Since it is already max Limit Break, the success rate is 100%.

An item that has been Limit Broken will only count as 1 copy if used as a material.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    Attach Ability Plugs on your duplicate weapons and transfer them to your main weapon through Limit Break to avoid having to spend Plug Removal Tickets!
</StickyNote>

Weapons, Battle Imagine, and Enhance Imagine all have tickets that can be used to substitute one copy of the item when Limit Breaking, mainly obtained through gacha, events, the Rose Orb Store, and Season Passes.

<StickyNote type="note">
    Limit Breaking a Battle Imagine to +5 increases the effectiveness and duration of any buffs and debuffs it provides to 1.5 times. This only applies at +5 and is multiplied AFTER the Imagine's Max Level Bonus (explanation below).
</StickyNote>

<StickyNote type="caution">
    Locked items are still be eligible to use as a Limit Break material. You will receive a warning message if you select an item that is locked.
</StickyNote>

## Weapons
Weapons provide stats and often have an element. Switching weapon types will automatically change your class (after completing the Class Master's [quest](/db/quest/SQ101_001)). Base weapons for each class can be purchased from the vendor in Asterleeds.

### Obtaining Weapons
Weapons can be obtained from treasure chests dropped by enemies inside of dungeons. You must successfully clear the entire dungeon to get treasure chest rewards. Specific drop rate information can be found on the [database](/db).

<details class="surface1 p-4 rounded-2xl" style="max-inline-size: var(--text-length)">
    <summary class="arrow accent2">Pre-Beyond: Crafting & Great Success</summary>
    <small class="text3 font-semibold">The following section applies to weapons added to the game before the Beyond update (v1.06.000).</small>
    <p>
        Weapons can also be crafted at the Crafting Machine found in town. Their recipes can be acquired through quests and <a href="/guides/adventure-boards">Adventure Boards</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When obtaining a weapon, either through crafting or from a chest, there is a chance of it being a <strong>Great Success</strong>, granting more plug sockets and higher special effect values. When crafting, there are tickets that can boost the Great Success rate. There are also tickets that can guarantee a Great Success, though the amount needed will vary based on the weapon.
    </p>
</details>

## Weapon Stats
Weapons can have an [element](/guides/combat#elements), so you can generate elemental charge even when using non-elemental skills. Both weapon element and skill element are [factors when determining damage](/guides/combat#weapon-skill-interaction). When your weapon element and skill element are the same, the Elemental Attack stat is added to your attack when calculating damage. 

### Legendary weapons and Special Effects
Weapons come with a Normal, Rare, or Legendary rarity that determines which Special Effects it can have. Normal Special Effects are typically stat increases, while Rare introduces some unique mechanics such as perfect dodging to generate a healing AoE. Legendary Special Effects are class-specific bonuses, such as Twin Striker's Moving Master which reduces Stamina consumption when dodging and jumping by up to 100%.

<p>
    A Special Effect typically has two values, though some Normal weapons have one. On Legendary weapons, <img src={assetUrl("/UI/Common/UI_CmnSpecileMain_Num1.webp")} alt="value I" width="16" height="20" class="inline" /> is the effectiveness of whatever bonus the Special Effect gives (i.e. Moving Master), and <img src={assetUrl("/UI/Common/UI_CmnSpecileMain_Num2.webp")} alt="value II" width="16" height="20" class="inline" /> is an attack bonus. Each value is randomly selected from a range of five tiers, such as 60%/70%/80%/90%/100% and 26%/27%/28%/29%/30%, respectively.
</p>

As of v1.06.000, each Legendary line has a 1% chance of dropping, and there are two lines per weapon type. Furthermore, the probability to get a double max roll is 1%. There exist tickets that reroll the Special Effect; tickets that reroll the Special Effect but guarantee the same rarity or higher; tickets that reroll only the values; and tickets that raise both values by 1 tier. 

<details class="surface1 p-4 rounded-2xl" style="max-inline-size: var(--text-length)">

    <small class="text3 font-semibold">The following section applies to weapons added to the game before the Beyond update (v1.06.000).</small>
    <p>
        Special Effects provide bonus damage to a classification of enemies. For example, a highly sought-after line is Ground Killer G1 which deals 11% bonus damage to all enemies that stand on the ground. The Special Effect on a weapon is randomly determined between a few weapon-specific options and cannot be changed. The bonus damage is randomly determined within a range.

### Limit Break Effect
At max Limit Break, weapons gain a Limit Break Effect which is simply an attack bonus. The value is randomly selected from a range of five tiers: 100/250/400/550/700. Both the Limit Break Effect and Special Effect can be transferred to another weapon via Limit Break.

### Weapon Battle Score
Weapon **Battle Score** can be represented as the following formula:

<Formula
    name="weaponBattleScore"
    tabs={[{
        label: "Formula",
        value: "formula",
        formula: `
            \\text{Weapon Battle Score} = 
            (60 \\times \\text{Item Level}) +

## Ability Plugs
Ability Plugs are weapon attachments that provide stat bonuses (ATK/HP/Stamina, etc.) or strengthen specific skills (cooldown reduction, skill damage, etc.). They are commonly obtained through dungeons, events, Mount Caravan, quests and Adventure Boards.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    The value of attack plugs has diminished considerably since the v1.06.000 update introduced weapons with very high attack. Skill plugs can be efficiently obtained through Rush Battle 3 (G1), Rush Battle 5 (G2), and Rush Battle 7 (G3).
</StickyNote>

Speak to the [Weapon Reconstructor](/map) to attach plugs to empty sockets by using [Union Paste](/db/items/175100000). The number of empty sockets is determined by probability when obtaining the weapon, and can be increased through Socket Expansion Tickets or Limit Breaking.

| Sockets  | Probability |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 75.000%     |
| 2        | 3.750%      | 
| 3        | 12.500%     | 
| 4        | 8.750%      |

<details class="surface1 p-4 rounded-2xl mt-4" style="max-inline-size: var(--text-length)">
    <summary class="arrow accent2">Pre-Beyond: Socket Probability</summary>
    <small class="text3 font-semibold">The following section applies to weapons added to the game before the Beyond update (v1.06.000).</small>
    <p>
        The number of empty sockets will be determined by whether the weapon was a Success or a Great Success. Since a Great Success is typically (if not always) 25%, the rates are mostly identical.

A plug's effectiveness is based on its grade (G1, G2, etc.) and its precision (1~5â˜…, randomly assigned when attached). [Tuning Tickets](/db/tokens/140000300) randomize the precision of all inserted plugs and [Ability Value Preservation Tickets](/db/tokens/140000400) lock plugs you don't want to reroll. The number of tickets needed will vary based on the weapon.

| Precision | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| 5â˜…        | 10%         |
| 4â˜…        | 10%         | 
| 3â˜…        | 20%         | 
| 2â˜…        | 30%         | 
| 1â˜…        | 30%         | 

<StickyNote type="note">
    You cannot attach multiple copies of the same plug into a weaponâ€”they must be different plugs or a different grade, i.e. Desperado G3 and Desperado G2.
</StickyNote>

Plugs can be removed using [Plug Removal Tickets](/db/tokens/140000700), though if you wish to keep the plug, you will need [Plug Retrieval Tickets](/db/tokens/140000900). The number of tickets needed will vary based on the weapon.
