## Overview
Liquid Memories are buffs that assist the player in progression-related tasks. While they don't increase combat prowess, they provide convenient effects that can increase efficiency when collecting materials or selling items.

## How to unlock
After reaching Adventurer Rank 3, complete the quest [When Life Gives You Memories](/db/quests/SQ101_127). Afterwards, Liquid Memory bottles can be unlocked through various methods such as clearing quests or opening treasure chests.

There are up to **three bottles** (M1, M2, M3) for each buff. Unlocking more bottles will increase the buff's duration or effectiveness.

## How to use
You can drink full bottles at the **Memory Stand** for a small fee. Mixing multiple buffs will activate all effects at once. 

Memory durations are either time-based or usage-based. Usage-based memories will be active until they are used up, so you can activate them and have them running in the background.

<StickyNote type="note">
    You can't drink a liquid memory whose effect is already active, even if you have full bottles. You must completely use up the buff before reactivating it. However, the bottles will continue to refill, even if its buff is active.

## Refilling Bottles
Each buff has different conditions for refilling. The first bottle of each buff can be filled by simply waiting for 360 minutes to pass (you do not have to be online during this time). Subsequent bottles will require specific actions from the player.
