## Joining a Team
There is no level or Adventurer Rank restriction for joining a Team. If you received an invite from a Team, you can accept it in the Team tab of the command menu.

Alternatively, at the Team Receptionist in North part of Asterleeds, you can search for an existing Team by ID or view a list of teams on the official website.

You can only be a member of one Team at a time.

## Forming a Team
After reaching Adventurer Rank 3, you can create a Team at the Team Receptionist in North Asterleeds for free.

You can set a Team name of up to 12 characters, and a Team tag (displayed next to your character name) of up to 4 characters. A random Team ID will be generated, which players can use to look up your Team in-game.

<StickyNote type="caution">
    If the Team leader does not log in for some time, leadership will be passed to another member (details unknown).
</StickyNote>

<StickyNote type="caution">
    After leaving a Team, there is a 24 hour cooldown before you can join a new Team.
</StickyNote>

<!-- TODO: Confirm if passing leader allows the new leader to use this ticket -->
The Team name and tag can be changed by using a Team Renaming Ticket. As of August 18, 2024, this ticket is not purchaseable but was distributed to Team leaders once in an update. 
<!-- The ticket does not go into your inventory; instead, it is property of the guild. -->

## Team Ranks
Teams have ranks that can be raised by filling the EXP meter through regular actions such as gathering resources and defeating enemies.
