It is highly recommended to use [Blood Axe](#723) before casting Desperado to negate its HP consumption. If you're using Blood Axe β, it's recommended to jump behind the enemy before charging to avoid dropping below 100% HP and losing the damage buff.

HP consumption is 20%/25%/30% at based on what level you charge Desperado to. Desperado will not reduce your HP to lower than 1. 

Pairing Desperado with [Ignition](#716) β will consume 90% HP while increasing Desperado’s Damage by a further 200%. Desperado α's second attack consumes an additional 60% HP, bringing the total to 150% in this scenario.  

**β** increases damage if your HP is low enough to fall within certain thresholds. β is mathematically slightly stronger in DPM than α due to its cooldown reduction (1305% &times; 6 vs 1800% &times; 4). However, this requires a situation where a Twin Striker can attack without interruption, and more importantly, factoring in Blood Axe β makes Desperado α the stronger option. Additionally, quick, short bursts of high damage are often more valuable than long-term sustained damage in BLUE PROTOCOL. Desperado β's high damage can still be useful for getting highest single-hit damage in raids or in Score Attack.
