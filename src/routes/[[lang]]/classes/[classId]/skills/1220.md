When used on the ground, Shield Charge will go through untargeted enemies and stun them as well. However, when used in the air, Shield Charge will stop at the first enemy hit. If you want to stun a group of enemies, you can target enemies behind you, or turn the camera to the ground or sky to avoid auto targeting a single enemy.

**Î±**'s second and third hits do not apply Stun.
