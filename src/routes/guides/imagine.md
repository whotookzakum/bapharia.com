Imagine are the embodiment of spiritual elements, such as powerful emotions or thoughts of a living creature. The three types are **Battle Imagine**, **Enhance Imagine**, and **Mount Imagine**.

### Battle Imagine
Battle Imagine are equipment that provide stat boosts and grant an **active skill** in one of three types; **Attack**, **Heal**, or **Support**. They can be crafted at the [Imagine Research Institute](/map) after unlocking their recipes.

The first way to unlock a recipe is by obtaining an **Idea** (one of their crafting materials) from the Named Enemies in the overworld. Check the [map](/map) for their locations. 

Another way to get a Battle Imagine's Idea is through treasure chests. Look up the Idea in the [database](/#db) for more information.

After learning the recipe, view the required materials at the Imagine Research Institute and hover over the information icons to see how to get them. Note that there is a minimum Adventurer Rank requirement to craft weapons.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    Use the Wishlist feature to show the crafting materials as a checklist without opening the menu!
</StickyNote>

At the Imagine Research Institute, view the Imagine you want to craft and click the "add to wishlist" button. Then, in your Command Menu > Quests > Wishlist, click the HUD checkbox to display the item where your quests appear in game.

Battle Imagine provide passive stats and a passive **Ability**, randomly selected from one of its potential abilities. Abilities typically include stat boosts and specific skill boosts.

<StickyNote type="caution">
    Players can equip up to 2 Battle Imagine, but they must be different Imagine.
</StickyNote>

Active skill cooldowns are independent of each other.  
Battle Imagine provide **10 &times; (Item Level)** Battle Score, and they will level sync if their max item level is higher than your current class level.

### Enhance Imagine
Enhance Imagine are equippable items that provide stat bonuses, similar to armor in other games. They do not alter your character's appearance.

Up to 5 Enhance Imagine can be worn, each in their respective, uniquely-shaped slots. They can be crafted at the [Imagine Research Institute](/map) once you've unlocked the recipe and meet the Adventurer Rank requirement.

Enhance Imagine recipes are acquired through completing their respective Adventure Boards. Quest icons that look like they have horns typically reward these Adventure Boards.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    If you know the name of the Enhance Imagine you want to craft, check the quest rewards before accepting. Otherwise, complete the quest and check the Adventure Board's final reward—the recipe's name—to see which Imagine it is.
</StickyNote>

Another way of unlocking recipes is through Treasure Chests. Look up the Imagine in the [database](/#db) for more information.

Like Battle Imagine, Enhance Imagine each come with a randomly selected **Ability** from their available abilities list.

Enhance Imagine provide **6 &times; (Item Level)** Battle Score, and they will level sync if their max item level is higher than your current class level.

### Mount Imagine
Mount Imagine are rideable creatures useful in traversing the open world.

Mounts have a standard running speed which is faster than player movement. They also have a faster dashing speed which consumes energy. Energy will quickly recover while not dashing. 

There are also tickets which can make it so your mount doesn't consume energy while dashing for the next X amount of days.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    Mount animations will not disrupt your movement—you can be running and jump onto your mount, or you can dismount straight into an attack!
</StickyNote>

The Land Fox Mount Imagine can be obtained as the final reward for the Adventure Board "Adventurer Rank 4".
