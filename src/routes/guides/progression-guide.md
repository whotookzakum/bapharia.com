This guide is to quickly get through the game contents and **will most likely change when new story quests are added and AR requirements are higher**. Information is current as of the Closed Beta Test.

## Level 1~10: Main Story Quest
Fight some elite monsters to overlevel and acquire the Mount Imagine ASAP (requires level 8; side quest from an NPC in Minsterhorn).
Grab any nearby warp gates and gather materials for the later quests during your travels.
Advanced players should farm materials for weapons/imagine along the way as well.

## Level 10~30: Arena
Craft the fire weapon for your class around level 10~15 (material locations overlap with story quests).
The arena is the most EXP-efficient dungeon.
Craft any 2 Battle Imagine with whatever materials you have.

## Level 30~35: Valley of Machines
Craft the earth weapon for your class. The materials take some time I recommend doing this after level 35.

## Complete your loadout
Gather Battle Imagine, Inner Imagine, then Battle Imagine for fusion into your weapon.
Some of the best fusion lines include:
- Damage Increase (Melee/Ranged, Normal Attacks, Ultimate, Tactical Skill)
- Reduce Cooldown (Ultimate)
- ATK
- Crit Rate
- Crit Damage
- Stamina Increase (for a potential animation-cancel meta)

The game loop is endlessly attempting to craft the god weapon (0.00272% chance or lower).
