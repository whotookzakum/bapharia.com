All missions can be entered solo or with a party (up to 6 players) with exception to Raids, which are up to 30 players.

After clearing a mission, the results screen will show your clear rewards and bonus rewards that can be claimed by using the Rewards Plus tickets. 
<StickyNote type="caution">
    Be careful as bonus rewards are set to be claimed by default, so you have to manually select the other box if you wish to not use your tickets.

## Dungeons
Dungeons are instances where up to 6 players can attempt to clear the dungeon boss before the timer runs out. They are not to be confused with Free Exploration dungeons, which are overworld instances of some dungeons--up to 30 players per channel can freely enter and leave.

Battle Areas are special areas in dungeons where some enemies need to be defeated before proceeding, to prevent players from rushing straight to the boss.  Dungeon minibosses also have a very low chance to drop a chest that can contain a weapon.

Players are provided with potions and buff consumables that can only be used in that dungeon and are deleted after exiting. Dungeons chests contain extra potions.

After clearing the Survey difficulty of a dungeon in the main story quest, the Additional Survey difficulty can be accessed through the Missions page on the Command Menu.

## Raids
Raids consist of a single boss fight with up to 30 players. Party leaders and solo players can queue for raid matchmaking at the raid's entrance. The revives are shared between all players in the raid.

Raids can have various mechanics and provide various ways for players to contribute. For example, the Demidragon raid has Engram Cannons that can freeze the boss and deal significant damage. After being fired, they go on cooldown.

Rewards are distributed to all players if the raid is cleared within the time limit. In addition to the clear rewards, extra rewards can be earned in various categories:
- Overall rank reward
- Class rank reward
- Most damage reward
- Highest damage reward
- Support reward
- Rescue reward (x2)
- Last hit reward
- Obstruction reward (disrupting enemy?)
- Artillery reward (Engram Cannons?)

## Time Attack
Not much is currently known about Time Attack dungeons. In the CBT, players could challenge Dragon Claw Valley solo or in a party, with a leaderboard for each class and for parties. The dungeon had some buff beacons that would provide movement speed and attack buffs.

Time Attack records will be recorded on the leaderboards found in cities. 

## Score Attack
Not much is currently known about Score Attack dungeons. It is supposedly a mode where players try to get as high a score as possible within a time limit. It's possible that it's similar to the Arena from CBT, where waves of enemies had to be cleared within the time limit. Score Attack records will be recorded on the leaderboards found in cities.

## Rush Battle
Rush Battle is held in the Asterliese Arena, where players fight continuous waves of enemies. Clear all the waves to complete the mission.

## Endless Tower
The Endless Tower is a series of dungeons where players aim to complete all 20 floors of enemies within the time limit. Some floors contain bosses alongside normal enemies. Every 5 floors is a rest area where players can use buff beacons and recover, though the timer does not pause on these floors.

The Tower of Beginnings was available in the Network Test. Not much else is known about this dungeon type yet.
