    The following guide follows the Japanese version of BLUE PROTOCOL published by Bandai Namco, and contents may change.
</StickyNote>

BLUE PROTOCOL's monetization scheme is intended to not provide any "pay-to-win" advantage, but rather players can pay for convenience and cosmetics. Related aspects include Rose Orbs, Gacha, Season Passes, and BP Points.

## Rose Orbs
Rose orbs are the paid currency in BLUE PROTOCOL. 
<!-- They expire 5 months after you purchase them, on the last day of the month.

<StickyNote type="note">
    There are payment limits based on age.<br />
    Ages 0~15: limit 5,000<br />
    Ages 16~17: limit 20,000<br />
    Ages 18~999: limit 9,999,999
</StickyNote>

The packs in the Japanese version are as follows:

<RoseOrbPacksOptions />
