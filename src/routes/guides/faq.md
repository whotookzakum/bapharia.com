### What is Blue Protocol?
Blue Protocol is an upcoming Online Action RPG developed by Bandai Namco in Unreal Engine 4. The game features anime-style artwork and a large open world that players can adventure in. The team behind Blue Protocol also worked on the Tales Series, Tekken and Ace Combat. The game has been in development for 6 years.

### What is the plot of Blue Protocol?
Two humans appear at the Asterleeds Cathedral, claiming to have traveled back 1000 years through space and time in order to release Avalitia and change the course of humanity for the better. Jake mentions that Avalitia is a monster from fairy tales, while the two time travelers give their own explanation to you. You then have to make the choice--whether to stand together or perish--and begin to uncover the truths of Avalitia and the world of Asteria while searching for your missing memories.

### How much will Blue Protocol cost?
Blue Protocol will be free to play in Japan. There will be no pay to win, and the developers want to monetize through cosmetics (accessories, hairstyles) and a seasonal Battle Pass.

### When will Blue Protocol be available in my country?  
The Japanese version was stated to release in Early Spring 2023, but was delayed after issues discovered before the Network Test. The Global version is planned to have a closed beta test in the first half of 2023, and will release in the second half of 2023.

### Will Blue Protocol come to console?
The game will be available on Xbox X|S and PlayStation 5, along with the PC versions available through Bandai Namco's launcher (Japan) and Steam (Global). 

### Will the game support 4K/ultrawide/higher than 1080p resolution?  
It was stated that at this time it will not officially support 4K resolution, but may be revisited in the future. This is to "preserve the art style".
 
### How many classes are there at the moment?
The game will release with 5 classes.  
Aegis Fighter, a tank with sword and shield.  
Blast Archer, a ranger class with support and recovery skills.  
Twin Striker, a class that uses dual axes and is DPS focused.  
Spell Caster, a magic using DPS class that provides elemental damage and debuffs.  
Heavy Smasher, a subtank/dps that uses a hammer-cannon to deal heavy hits and CC targets.  
You will be able to freely switch between classes on your character(s) by switching weapons in town..

### Will there be a trinity system? (Tank/Healer/Damage class roles)
Yes. Although it seems the team originally did not want a trinity system, they stated after the CBT that they want to clearly distinguish the class roles. Additionally, certain classes have skills that make them much more suitable for a role. There is some overlap as well, for example Twin Striker can heal itself and allies with a life-drain buff.

### Will there be more classes?
Yes; the game will release with the 5 classes mentioned above, and more classes will be added in the future. Existing classes will have their playability expanded as well.

### Is Blue Protocol open world?
It is not open world in the sense of seamless exploration with zero loading screens like Breath of the Wild or Tower of Fantasy. However, the zones are very large and can be maneuvered around relatively freely, so you can explore without much invisible barriers and won't be running into loading screens too often.
 
### Will there be PvP?
PvP is currently not under development as they want to focus on Story and PvE first. A (player) Party vs (enemy) Party system exists in the Arena in Asterleeds (the main town). You can compete in the rankings for speed clears. Player vs Player may be implemented at a later date, but is highly unlikely. They want all features in the game to connect to gameplay/benefit your character, but they do not want to force casual players to PvP either.

### How do cosmetics interact with armor?
There is no "armor" per-se. Equipment that provide stats, besides your weapon, do not alter your appearance. Cosmetic items do not provide stats. As a result, you can dress the way you want while equipping the items that you want.

### What is an Imajinn/Imagine/Echo?
Imagine (Echoes) are creatures that aid you in your journey. There are three types:  
1. Battle Imagine that help you in combat
2. Enhance Imagine that provide passive stats
3. Mount Imagine that are rideable mounts

### Will there be housing?
Yes, it will be added in an update after official release.

### Will there be marriage?
Currently unknown.

### Is there trading?
No, and it is highly unlikely to be added in order to prevent RMT.
 
### Can my system run / handle Blue Protocol? What setting can I run it at?  
Below are the recommended settings for the Network Test.
