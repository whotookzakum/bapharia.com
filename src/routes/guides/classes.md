BLUE PROTOCOL will launch with 5 classes, with more in development. Each class has a unique mechanic that influences their gameplay. 

## Aegis Fighter
The Aegis Fighter (Blade Warden) is a short-range class that fights on the front line, utilizing offensive and defensive skills. Aegis Fighters wield a one-handed sword and shield and are **mainly a tank class**. Their skills excel in crowd-control and enemy aggro management. They have various Light-elemental skills.

### Shield Gauge
Aegis Fighters can hold down the subaction button to enter a guard stance. Successful blocks of enemy attacks will consume Shield Gauge. Once the gauge is depleted, shield-related skills will be temporarily unavailable.

Press the normal attack button after blocking to perform a powerful counterattack.

## Blast Archer
The Blast Archer (Keen Strider) is a long-range class that attacks enemies and **supports** allies from afar. Blast Archers utilize a bow and quiver to provide support from a safe distance. Their skills excel in supporting teammates through healing, buffing, and dispelling abnormal statuses, as well as applying debuffs on enemies. They have various Earth-elemental skills, and can be played with either auto-targeting or manual aim. 

### Buff Charge Gauge
By dealing damage, Blast Archers can charge the Buff Charge Gauge up to level 3. Using the subaction, Cure Arrow, will consume the gauge and place a healing field at the selected location. The heal amount will differ based on the gauge level. The gauge will charge more when dealing critical hits and hitting enemy weak points.

### Weak-point Targeting
Blast Archers deal increased damage when hitting an enemy's weak point. These points vary between enemies, such as the head or back. You may be able to hit weak spots with auto aim on some enemies, but this is unlikely to be the case for most enemies so players will have to switch between auto and manual aim for maximum efficiency.

## Heavy Smasher
The Heavy Smasher (Foe Breaker) is a close-range class that uses dynamic, heavy attacks to engage enemies. Heavy Smashers use a cannon-hammer and are a **sub-tank/damage class**. Their skills excel in crowd-control and dealing damage. They have various Earth-elemental skills.

### Cartridge 
Certain Heavy Smasher skills consume ammunition from the cartridge, with different skills consuming different amounts. If there are remaining rounds in the cartridge, *holding* the subaction button will reload the cartridge. If the cartridge is completely empty, *pressing* the subaction button will initiate a Quick Reload, granting 2 extra rounds of ammunition.

## Spell Caster
The Spell Caster (Spell Weaver) is a long-range classes that uses Fire, Ice, and Thunder elemental skills to deal massive damage to enemies from afar. Spell Casters use a rod as their weapon, and are **mainly a damage class**. Their skills excel in dealing burst damage and minimal crowd-control, and their continuous use of elements can greatly contribute to the [Elemental Charge Gauge](/guides/elements#elemental-charge). 

### EP Gauge
Spell Caster skills do not have cooldowns, and instead consume EP from the EP Gauge. Different skills require different amounts of EP. EP will slowly recover over time, and can be quickly recharged by holding the subaction button.

## Twin Striker
The Twin Striker is a close-range class that unleashes fast combo attacks to continuously deal damage. Twin Strikers use dual axes and are **mainly a damage class**. Their skills excel in life-steal and dealing continuous damage, and their fast attacks can greatly contribute to the Party Chain. They have various Fire-elemental skills.

### Combo Gauge
Twin Strikers will build Combo Gauge with each successful hit. The Combo Gauge is a damage multiplier that increases the power of all their attacks. If their HP drops below a certain amount, the gauge will be reset back to 0. 

## Changing Classes
To change classes, complete the Class Master's quest "A World of Possibilities" in the Reclamation Bureau in Asterliese. After that, you can switch to a weapon of a different class to change classes. Starter weapons can be purchased from the weapon shop in cities.

## Class Abilities
When building your loadout, players have the option to select up to two Class-restricted abilities, and two Class-shared abilities. Class-restricted abilities are passive bonuses that can only be applied to your current class, whereas Class-shared abilities are passives that can be shared between classes. Only a subset of abilities can be shared, so be sure to check the [database](/db) for those!
