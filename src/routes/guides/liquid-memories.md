## What are Liquid Memories?
Liquid Memories are buffs that be activated at a **Memory Stand**. 

## How to unlock
After reaching Adventurer Rank 3, complete the quest "Welcome to the Memory Stand!" which can be accepted from the quest receptionist in Asterleeds. 
Afterwards, Liquid Memory bottles can be unlocked through quests (and possibly hidden throughout the world). Check the [map](/map) for the quest locations.

There are up to **three bottles** (M1, M2, M3) for each buff. Unlocking more bottles will increase the buff's duration or effectiveness.

## How to use
You can drink full bottles at the Memory Stand for a small fee. Mixing multiple buffs will activate all effects at once. 

<StickyNote type="note">
    You can't drink a liquid memory whose effect is already active, even if you have full bottles. You must completely use up the buff before reactivating it. However, the bottles will continue to refill, even if its buff is active.
</StickyNote>

## Refilling Bottles
Each buff has different conditions for refilling. The first bottle of each buff can be filled by simply waiting for 360 minutes to pass (you do not have to be online during this time). 

See the table below for a brief overview of the buffs, and click the links to see more details on each liquid memory.
