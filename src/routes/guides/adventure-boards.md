An Adventure Board is a collection of tasks that correlate with the board's theme. They can reward **weapon recipes** and **Enhance Imagine recipes**, and some are a prerequisite to **increasing your Adventurer Rank**. 

Thus completing Adventure Boards is key to unlocking more Main Story Quests, acquiring new equipment, and progressing through the game. For data on specific Adventure Boards and their tasks, check the [database](/db).

## Obtaining Boards
Adventure Boards can be obtained by completing quests--mainly Key Character Quests, indicated by a quest icon with horns. After unlocking a board, you can accept it from your Command Menu > Quests > Adventure Boards.

## Accepting Boards
Adventure Boards need to be accepted before you can make progress toward their tasks. Click on a board and then click the long rectangular accept button at the top. You can also choose to display it on the in-game HUD to easily track progress on tasks.

<StickyNote type="tip">
    Up to 8 boards can be accepted at a time, so accept the boards with overlaping tasks at the same time! 
</StickyNote>

## Task Tree
Every Adventure Board comes in a unique tree shape, where the tasks along the main path must be completed in order. Tasks that do not have a line connected to them can be completed in parallel, at any time. It's highly recommended you complete the side tasks, as they can provide a considerable amount of crafting materials or other helpful things related to the main reward.

Tasks typically involve defeating enemies, gathering, clearing dungeons, and completing quests.
