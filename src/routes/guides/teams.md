## Joining a team
There is no level or Adventurer Rank restriction for joining a team. If you received an invite from a team, you can accept it in the team tab of the command menu.

Alternatively, at the Team Receptionist in North part of Asterleeds, you can search for an existing team by ID or view a list of teams on the official website.

You can only be a member of one team at a time.

## Forming a team
After reaching Adventurer Rank 3, you can create a team at the Team Receptionist in North Asterleeds. It doesn't cost anything to create a team.

You can set a team name of up to 12 characters, and a team tag (displayed next to your character name) of up to 4 characters. A random Team ID will be generated, which players can use to look up your team in-game.

<StickyNote type="caution">
    If team leaders do not log in for a long time, privileges will be passed to other members. There are some cooldowns on things like guild disbandment, expulsions, and leaving the guild (details unknown).
</StickyNote>

The team name and tag can be changed by using renaming tickets.

## Team Ranks
Teams have ranks (levels) that can be raised by filling the EXP meter through regular actions such as gathering resources and defeating enemies.

There is a team chat channel where you can talk with other members of your team. At the time of release, there will be no content that is exclusive to being in a team, however this is being considered for future updates.
