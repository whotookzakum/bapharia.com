Beast Swing be useful for closing the distance between enemies as it takes a large step with its first blow.

Due to Twin Striker's short cooldowns, it's recommended to only use the backward and forward variants of this skill to apply buffs/debuffs. The sideways input could be useful in mobbing when paired with jump cancelling, but it pushes enemies too much to spam consistently. 

The post-skill delay on Beast Swing isn't that high so your class action is better used to animation cancel other skills.
