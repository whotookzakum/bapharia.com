Fall Impact is useful for getting close to enemies. When used mid-air, another jump will be performed causing the player to leap forward. It can be used to force the player to jump forward when out of stamina. Fall Impact is useful in TA/SA as a movement skill. 

**G4** has a hidden damage increase.

If the Jump does not reach its maximum height (due to being blocked by the enemy's model or environment), its Damage will be lowered.
