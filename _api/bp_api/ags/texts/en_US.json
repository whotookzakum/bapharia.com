He then turned his eyes on us, and drew closer and closer... We had nowhere to flee—we were going to have to fight him. But just as we had resolved to fight an unwinnable battle, the young women nearby created a sphere of light, and told us to jump into it. We did what they said. We felt as though we were floating, the light disappeared...and the next thing we knew, we were back in the room as it was earlier. The Aberration was still sealed above us, and Voldigen was nowhere to be seen. It was if none of what we had witnessed had happened.\r\n\r\nThe two women finally explained the situation to us.

She had infiltrated the Bapharian Church on Voldigen's orders. She monitored the stimulation of bioflux that came about as a result of Aeryn releasing Aberrations. Voldigen's goal is to devour Aeryn and gain power, and her whereabouts and condition were leaked to him by Fédra.\r\n\r\nWe were helpless against the onslaught of Voldigen's overwhelming power and were defeated. And just when he had caught Aeryn and was near to consuming her, the Echo Seed I received from Calvain began to shine, and a beautiful voice singing began to flow from it. Voldigen was stricken by this, and he flew away. But before we could collect ourselves, Fédra shapeshifted into a massive form and attacked us. After what was assuredly a life-or-death struggle for us, she disappeared into a deep valley, and we lost all sight of her. The dracari threat has passed. And myself, Feste, Aeryn, and Tyris all managed to survive."

He seems to have expected the Aberration to be there, but how could he have known that? In any event, he gave me an Echo Seed that he cited as his greatest treasure as thanks for helping him. The moment I took it in hand, the strangest sight flashed through my mind: a young boy swinging a sword in some indeterminate place. Another person stood watching at his side. When I came back to myself, Calvain had already left. I'll have to ask him about what I saw if we run into each other again.

I then caught a glimpse of Charlotte as she was leaving. Feste seemed to have noticed too, so we pursued her to the entrance of the city. When we caught up to her, she seemed concerned about the armed group that had attacked her. She was afraid of getting the others caught up in the danger, and so had decided to leave by herself. Suddenly, we heard Calvain and Elenyne calling out. As her friend, Elenyne was insistent in wanting to help Charlotte. What's more, with Calvain being a knight of Byrnhald, he was perfectly-suited to protecting Charlotte. On top of that, he had his own reasons for wanting to go into hiding, and he could shelter Charlotte with himself. Convinced, Charlotte left town alongside Calvain. A relief to be sure. Meanwhile, Elenyne explained that she had something she wanted to ask us. Once things have settled down, we should go and hear her out."

However, this resulted in the distortion caused by the Aberrants to accumulate, and led the planet to ruin.

Hearing this, there was a faint glimmer in Feste's eyes.\r\n\r\nBachelard awaited at the timegate on the uppermost floor. Something in his face was familiar. He was the man glimpsed in the dream, the one who dragged the crying boy's mother away from him. Bachelard looked at our group and then attacked without a word. Tyris was beaten back, and Aeryn fell unconscious. Bachelard took Aeryn through the timegate, and was gone. \r\n\r\nAn Echo Seed remained, and from it could be heard a voice.

An alarm rang out, and Bachelard began to issue orders, but the Aberrant Nexus did not stop. I failed to grab Tyris' outstretched hand, and she was absorbed into the Nexus. At the next moment, the thing let out a burst of brilliant light, and then vanished. \r\n\r\nAccording to Bachelard, the Nexus jumped from this era to 1000 years prior—our own time. What's more, it disrupted spacetime in such a way that we cannot timeleap and pursue it. It was into this stalemate that Fédra and Merloth arrived. After being caught up on all the circumstances, Merloth said that he would make it so we'd be able to timeleap. Half in doubt, we made our way to the timegate and found that spacetime had indeed been stabilized—meaning a timeleap would indeed be possible. Bachelard proposed an alliance in which we'd cooperate to seize the Aberrant Nexus. Aeryn seemed desperate not to agree, but nonetheless prioritized rescuing Tyris and accepted the proposal. After all, Bachelard's support would be essential in securing the chronus we'd need to undertake the rescue. Leaving Fédra to monitor things, once more we timeleaped, this time back to our own time.

We traveled together, and she explained Bachelard's plan, the Aberrant Nexus Project. By fusing Aeryn with a special machine called the Aberrant Nexus, it would give him control over all of the other Aberrations. There are of course many who opposed this plan, and so in the end it was decided that Aeryn would instead release the Aberrations. However, Bachelard had expected this, and as a result of her releasing Aberrations, her bioflux was stimulated, making it even easier for her to be merged with the Nexus. And the plan is on the cusp of being completed—meaning we need to hurry to the research facility as soon as possible and put a stop to it."

However, the true purpose of the plan is not to control Aberrants, but to control the Telluric Beast, a creature that destroys overdeveloped civilizations. Controlling this creature, not merely the realm of faerie tales but actual reality, was the entire purpose of the Aberrant Nexus plan. Bachelard explained that Aeryn's sacrifice is unavoidable if we are to protect the planet and civilization itself. Tyris refused to accept this, and stated clearly her intent to save Aeryn. Fédra took care of the soldiers dispatched by Bachelard—and if we follow the trail of her rampage, we ought to be able to get to the research facility. We're so close to saving Aeryn."

What's more, the culprit seems to be Calvain, and a warrant for his arrest has been issued. The Duke was supposed to have been ill and recuperating. There's no way he could have been assassinated in the dracari attack, nor of course would Calvain have ever been the one to do the deed. Nonetheless, it seems clear that there is some discrepancy with the history we know, and my money's on the Aberrant Nexus being the cause.
