BLUE PROTOCOL has several components that contribute to its fast-paced action. Let's take a look at each aspect of combat.

## [Party vs Party](#party-vs-party)
Not your typical PvPâ€”this is Player Party vs Enemy AI Party. Similar to players, enemies will cooperate and try to take down you and your allies.

## [EXP & Drops Distribution](#exp-and-drops)
All parties with a member that dealt at least 1 damage to a monster will received full EXP and drops.

## [Stamina](#stamina)
Stamina will be consumed when sprinting or evading while within an enemy's aggro range. Evading can be used to cancel most attack animations.

## [Elements](#elements)
Enemies have elemental weaknesses. Try out our simulation below.


## [Buffs & Debuffs](#buffs-and-debuffs)
Abnormal statuses that can be applied to players or enemies. Check out the buffs below.

## [Skills](#skills)
You can assign 4 tactical skills, 3 tactical abilities, 1 ultimate skill, and any amount of permanent skills. View these on the interactive skill builder. The development team has stated that they prefer to add more skill diversity rather than a bunch of new classes.

## [Mechanics](#mechanics)
**Assault Attack** Melee classes receive a damage bonus and enemy knockdown when dropping onto enemies from high ground.
**Dodge Attack** Attack right after dodging will allow a seamless transition into the attack animation.
**Perfect Dodge** Dodging with excellent timing will grant you class-unique bonuses and buffs indicated by a blue particle effect.
**Elevation Bonus** Ranged classes receive a damage bonus when attack enemies from high ground.
