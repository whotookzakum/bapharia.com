BLUE PROTOCOL has several components that contribute to its fast-paced action. Let's take a look at each aspect of combat.

## Party vs Party
Not your typical PvP—this is Player Party vs Enemy AI Party. Similar to players, enemies will cooperate and try to take down you and your allies.

## EXP & Drops Distribution
All parties with a member that dealt at least 1 damage to a monster will received full EXP and drops.

## Stamina
Stamina will be consumed when sprinting or evading while within an enemy's aggro range. Evading can be used to cancel most attack animations.

## Elements
Elemental attacks apply abnormal statuses on targets and boost damage output. They can be utilized through elemental skills and weapons with elements.

Using elements on an enemy causes elemental charge to accumulate. For simplicity, let's use the number 100. 

When elemental charge exceeds 100, a debuff will be applied. The debuff is determined by the element that contributed the most charge towards reaching 100. So if we had Fire +40, Earth +30, and Ice +30, the Fire debuff would be applied. Attacking with different elements will still build elemental charge, but only one debuff will be applied.

The debuffs have 3 levels—level 1 applies an abnormal status (debuff), level 2 applies a stronger abnormal status, and level 3 triggers a burst effect.
Some information is still unknown;  
- Can the debuff's element change between levels, or is it permanently determined at level 1? If it can change, are subsequent levels based on total charge or individual level charge?
- Does elemental charge overflow into the next level, or does it start at 0 for each level?
- How is debuff and burst effect damage calculated when multiple players are attacking the same enemy?

| Element | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| Fire    | | | |
| Lightning | | | |
| Light | | | |
| Ice | | | |
| Earth | | | |
| Dark | | | |

## Buffs & Debuffs
Abnormal statuses that can be applied to players or enemies. Check out the buffs below.

## Skills
You can assign 4 tactical skills, 3 tactical abilities, 1 ultimate skill, and any amount of permanent skills. View these on the interactive skill builder. The development team has stated that they prefer to add more skill diversity rather than a bunch of new classes.

## Mechanics
**Assault Attack** Melee classes receive a damage bonus and enemy knockdown when dropping onto enemies from high ground.
**Dodge Attack** Attack right after dodging will allow a seamless transition into the attack animation.
**Perfect Dodge** Dodging with excellent timing will grant you class-unique bonuses and buffs indicated by a blue particle effect.
**Elevation Bonus** Ranged classes receive a damage bonus when attack enemies from high ground.
