## Overview
Your first class is chosen during character creation. Each class has a unique mechanic that influences their gameplay.

Players have the option to select up to two **Class-restricted abilities**, and two **Class-shared abilities**. Class-restricted abilities are passive bonuses that can only be applied to your current class, whereas Class-shared abilities are passives that can be used on other classes.

### Changing Classes
To change classes, complete the Class Master's quest [A World of Possibilities](/db/quests/SQ101_001) in the Reclamation Bureau in Asterliese. Afterwards, you can change classes by equpping a weapon of another class while outside of combat. Starter weapons can be purchased from the weapon shops found in cities.
